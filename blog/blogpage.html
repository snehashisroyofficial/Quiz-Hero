            What is event delegation in JavaScript, and how does it work?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-green-600">Answer: </span>Event delegation is a
            technique in JavaScript where instead of attaching event listeners
            to individual elements, you attach a single event listener to a
            parent element. This listener then waits for events to bubble up
            from the child elements. When an event occurs, the parent element's
            event listener handles it, and you can use event.target to identify
            the specific child element that triggered the event. Event
            delegation is useful for efficiently handling events on dynamically
            created or large numbers of elements.

            Explain the concept of asynchronous programming in JavaScript and
            how it differs from synchronous programming.
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-green-600">Answer: </span>Asynchronous programming
            in JavaScript allows tasks to be executed concurrently, without
            blocking the execution of subsequent code. This is achieved through
            mechanisms like callbacks, promises, and async/await. In contrast,
            synchronous programming executes tasks one after the other, blocking
            the execution of subsequent code until each task is completed.
            Asynchronous programming is essential for handling tasks such as
            fetching data from servers, performing animations, and executing
            time-consuming operations without freezing the user interface.

            What are the differences between let, const, and var for declaring
            variables in JavaScript?
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-green-600">Answer: </span>let and const are
            block-scoped variables introduced in ES6, while var is
            function-scoped. let allows reassignment of its value, whereas const
            creates a constant variable whose value cannot be changed once
            assigned. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of
            their scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior. let and const
            provide better control over variable scoping and are generally
            preferred over var in modern JavaScript development.

            Explain the concept of prototypal inheritance in JavaScript and how
            it differs from classical inheritance in other programming
            languages.
          </h2>
          <p>
            <span class="text-green-600">Answer: </span>Prototypal inheritance
            is a fundamental concept in JavaScript where objects inherit
            properties and methods directly from other objects. Each object in
            JavaScript has a prototype chain, which allows it to inherit
            properties and methods from its prototype object. This differs from
            classical inheritance, commonly found in languages like Java and
            C++, where classes are used to create objects and inheritance is
            achieved through class hierarchies. Prototypal inheritance in
            JavaScript promotes code reusability and flexibility, allowing
            objects to inherit behavior dynamically at runtime.
